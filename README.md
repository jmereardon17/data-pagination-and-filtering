# Data Pagination and Filtering

A treehouse FSJS techdegre project in which I had to use a common web development technique known as "pagination" to enhance the usability of a web page.

The project contains data for 42 students, including name, email, and picture. I had to use JavaScript to display the first nine students on the page. Then add navigation, also known as pagination buttons, that the user can click to display different pages of students.

The application needed to work with a list of any number of students, not just with the supplied array of 42 students. Which means that the solution I had to implement needed to be flexible enough to handle arrays of student data of various lengths.

Extra functionality was developed to achieve the highest grade:
- Add a Search component
- Add Functionality to the Search Component
- Add Pagination for Search Results
- Handle No Search Matches

Grade: Exceeds Expectations
